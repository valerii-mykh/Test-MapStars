                            Ceramic Pro is the first client of the company in Latvia, as well as the first client
                            abroad.
                            After changing the car wash system and approach to working with the client, under the new
                            Ceramic Pro brand, the task was to bring more customers in the 16/17 tourist season than in
                            the 15/16 season.
                            The main focus of the photo session/photo presentation was to be the Ceramic Pro logo and
                            new corporate identity, as well as the workflow and higher level of the average customer.
                            This project has become a pilot project for our company in terms of introducing a unique
                            Motivator design with the logo of the client's company. The task was also to orient the
                            issue in Google search for a Russian-speaking tourist/client.
                            The result was not long in coming, already in the next 16/17 season in Jurmala, 17% more
                            customers turned to the car wash than in the 15/16 season. According to our forecasts, they
                            should grow up to 25% over the next

                            Ceramic Pro Latvia</h3>
                        <p class="examples__text">
                            Ceramic Pro is the first client of the company in Latvia, as well as the first client
                            abroad.
                            After changing the car wash system and approach to working with the client, under the new
                            Ceramic Pro brand, the task was to bring more customers in the 16/17 tourist season than in
                            the 15/16 season.
                            The main focus of the photo session/photo presentation was to be the Ceramic Pro logo and
                            new corporate identity, as well as the workflow and higher level of the average customer.
                            This project has become a pilot project for our company in terms of introducing a unique
                            Motivator design with the logo of the client's company. The task was also to orient the
                            issue in Google search for a Russian-speaking tourist/client.
                            The result was not long in coming, already in the next 16/17 season in Jurmala, 17% more
                            customers turned to the car wash than in the 15/16 season. According to our forecasts, they
                            should grow up to 25% over the next
